# BoredGame - Supabase Setup Instructions

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

**IMPORTANT: You need to run the SQL commands in your Supabase dashboard before the multiplayer features will work.**

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in

### Step 2: Run the Database Schema
1. Copy all the SQL commands from `database_schema.sql`
2. Paste them into the SQL Editor

- **Indexes**: For better performance
- **Row Level Security**: With open policies for now

After running the SQL, you should see the following tables in your database:
- `rooms`
- `players` 
- `game_sessions`
- `rounds`
- `player_answers`
- `scores`
- `tic_tac_toe_moves`

### Step 4: Test the Application
